## Instructions

Hey hey hey!

If you are coding for multiple robots, create different folders for each team. Then, make a Robot{teamnumber}.java
file for each team. Then, you can extend the interface for the code inside of ./Robot.java (how you
choose which robot to upload to). 

You will also want to make different DriverControlled and Autonomous code for the 2 teams

Copy this and paste it into a new file, and replace all of the {teamnumber} with the Team Number:
